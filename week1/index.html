                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
            I was born in 1854 in the English countryside. As a child, I often found 
            it difficult to make friends because of my astute powers of observation.
            As an adult, I've taken those same powers of observation and made a 
            career out of helping clients with cases that elude them. In my 
            free time, I enjoy spending time with my best friend, Watson, and our 
            housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson.

                <p>
                Oxford University, 1874 (Please note that most of my education 
                has been gained through experience (see <a href="#exp">Experience</a> below)).

                I've worked many cases for many different clients; the list below 
                highlights some of my more illustrious moments. I've worked with 
                Scotland Yard, kings, princes, paupers, and more.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>: wherein I solved the murder 
                    of Sir Charles Baskerville for Dr. James Mortimer. Contrary to popular
                    superstition, Sir Baskerville had not been murdered on the moors by a 
                    spectral hound.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>A Scandal in Bohemia</i>: wherein I located an object of some
                    impropriety for the King of Bohemia. In the course of locating the 
                    object, I disguised myself multiple times. After gaining access by 
                    those means, I pinpointed the exact location of the object by making
                    the object's owner believe her domicile was on fire. Although the object 
                    was not ultimately recovered, the King was quite pleased with the 
                    resolution of the case. He shall be happy to recommend me. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>The Dancing Men</i>: wherein I deciphered a secret code 
                    involving stick figures for Mr. Hilton Cubitt of Riding Thorpe Manor.
                    Had Mr. Cubitt approached me sooner, his life likely would have been
                    saved. I was able to disprove the local constabulary's theory that 
                    Mrs. Cubitt had killed her late husband whilst simultaneously 
                    uncovering the identity of the actual murderer.</li>

                This webpage was created as part of my ongoing web development education.
                In creating this webpage, I have intentionally used the following 
                learning practices:
                <ul>
                    <li>Retrieval Practice: I wrote as much of the page as I could 
                        without referring to any notes or other resources, intentionally
                        to force my brain to recall as much of it as possible. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Interleaving: I intentionally switched between skills/tasks.</li>
                    <li>Spaced Practice: I did this less intentionally, but as I wrote
                        the page over the course of several days, I necessarily engaged
                        with skills in shorter chunks over a period of time.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
                Some resources that I've found helpful as I learn to be a web developer:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>: 
                    extensive tutorials on web development subjects. I also really appreciate
                    their articles and other information on becoming a developer.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>:
                    whenever I search for how to do something in HTML or CSS, this is generally
                    the first result that comes up. Information is organized in a clean, accessible
                    way, so I sometimes just browse and learn.</li>

                    CSS Precedence Tutorial</a></li>
                </ul>
                I'm learning to be a web developer with the help of an awesome course at 
                <a href="https://www.foocafe.org/" target="_blank">Foo Cafe</a> in Stockholm.
