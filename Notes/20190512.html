            Working on same file from last week (week02class)
            How the Internet Works:
                load content from http: address
                www = world wide web
                .afterwww = domain
                ex: google.com
                ping google.com - will show you the IP of google.com
                static websites are html pages that we're working on now consists of static host that is a drive that is mapped with an IP
                dynamic websites (web apps originally) consists of stitic servers, app stuff, data servers
                -will cover dynamic stuff after javascript and more back end stuff
